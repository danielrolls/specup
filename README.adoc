= SpecUP

This tool can be used to generate a markup file from your own arbitrary yaml file. Just provide the yaml and a template (in mustache format) and the tool outputs the result of applying the template to yaml. This can be quicker and easier than starting a project in your favourite language and easier to maintain.

Expect the interface to move around a bit. I'm pondering whether to enable direct Pandoc integration for convenience or whether to keep with the Unix philosophy of just doing one job well.

To try the tool out, install https://nixos.org/download[Nix] and run `nix run github:danielrolls/specup -- --help`.
